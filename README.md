# Using LiDAR Data to Model Canopy Height in Central Appalachia
The goal of this project was to create a wall-to-wall 10m canopy height model (CHM) for 73 counties in Central Appalachia by processing high-resolution aerial LiDAR point cloud data collected between 2015 and 2023. As byproducts of this process, I also created a digital terrain model (DTM) and digital surface model (DSM) of the study region. Canopy height is a useful metric of vegetation loss and recovery in mined areas, as well as an accurate proxy for above-ground biomass.
